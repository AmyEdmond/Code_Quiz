## Installation

N/A


## Usage

When I am taking the code quiz a timer starts and I am presented with a question
when I click the start button. An answered question is followed with another question.
If I answer a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock
When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. I can then save my initials and my score.
